##  How It Works
Pixelo uses a small and efficient algorithm that generates pixel art based on predefined or randomized patterns. The algorithm processes simple shapes and colors to create pixelated visuals that can be customized by the user in terms of color, scale, and randomness.

## 🛠️ Customization
You can tweak various parameters in the `config.js` file, such as:
- **Art Style**: Abstract, grid-based, or random pixel patterns
- **Size**: Adjust pixel size and resolution
- **Colors**: Set a palette or randomize color choices
